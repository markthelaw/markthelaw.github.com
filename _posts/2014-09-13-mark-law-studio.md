##New Website

I have purchased a domain from Google Domain. It was only 12 dollars a month. I am hosting the website on my own home. Great opportunity to get familiar with Apache. I realize many app ideas I have got requires some sort of back end. So I need to have my own server anyway. Reference it with IP is fine with projects. But since a domain is so cheap, and also an opportunity to test out new Google services!



### NibbleBlog
I have decided to use nibbleblog as my home page blog for the following reasons
1. One Click Install - it literally took me less than 1 minute to setup.
2. Similar to Jekyll, it does not require database setup. Everything is Static.
3. Every thing is GUI, which some might like or might not like. Jekyll is definitely more popular. But Nibbleblog is even easier setup than Jekyll.


The only downside I have discovered is that the customization is lacking. But it should be enough for my needs. I personally don't want to spend too much time in learning all the powerful features of blogging. My requirement is to post what I am working on. 


There is one more thing, I have not figured out how to port Jekyll posts to Nibbleblog posts. But I will leave both site online parallely.
